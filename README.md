# Rock Paper Scissors

This is an application that allows a user to play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer. The user selects format, either Standard RPS, with 3 choices, or Magic: The Gathering RPS, with 5 choices. The app keeps track of all time score between the user, known as a "planewalker", and the computer, know as a "construct".

## How to use?

The site is live at https://hayleyw7.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/.

The user starts on the home page with a score of 0 for both the "Planeswalker" (the user) and the "Construct" (the computer).

The user can select a game to play, either "Standard", which is the common version of Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS), or "Magic: The Gathering", which is a Magic: The Gathering themed (MTG) version of a RPS variant called Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock.

If the user selects "Standard", they are presented with 3 images: rock, paper, and scissors. When they click one, the computer also randomly selects one, and those two selections will display on the screen. The winner gains one point, and the original rock, paper, and scissors images will display again. From there, user can play again by clicking an image, or they can click "Change Format" to go back to the home page.

If the user selects "Magic: The Gathering", they are presented with 5 images: rock, paper, scissors, lizard, alien. When they click one, it works just as in the previous game, except for five MTG choices instead of three RPS choices.

If at any point a user wants to clear store to 0-0, they can click "Start Over" on the home page.
